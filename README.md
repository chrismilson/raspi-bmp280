# BMP280

The
[BMP280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/pressure-sensors-bmp280-1.html)
is a very small barometric pressure and temperature calculating integrated
circuit. I want to test it out on my raspberry pi, so I have made this small
repo to transfer code between the pi and my main pc where implementing is
easier.
